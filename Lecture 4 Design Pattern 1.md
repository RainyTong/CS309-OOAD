# Design pattern 1

### Strategy Pattern

> - "Gang of Four " ==> 4 authors of the book *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*

:blush:Design Principles —— Indentify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate them from what stays the same.

- Encapsulate what varies
- Program to an interface, not to an implementation
- Favor composition over inheritance

:wink:Liskov Substitution Principle —— Let q(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
